# Installation Requirements
Please install the following libraries/packages.

### Node Version Manager (NVM)

https://github.com/creationix/nvm

### Node.js through NVM

Simple as:

    $ nvm install 0.10
    $ nvm use 0.10

This should also install the __Node Package Manager (NPM)__.

### Cordova CLI

    $ npm install -g cordova


### Android or iOS Toolkit (as needed)

You are not *required* to locally download and install the Android/iOS debug toolkits, but sometimes they are helpful! Specifically, it is useful to get Eclipse installed to debug some specific Android errors, or Xcode for iOS.


### Server Requirements

See __Chapter 10: API Server__.
