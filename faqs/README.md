# FAQs

### Is Windows Phone supported? 

No. Famo.us doesn't support IE currently. Phonegap uses the platform's native rendering engine (Windows Phone uses IE, Android uses Chrome, iOS uses Safari) and we don't have a PhoneGap/Chromium wrapper for Windows Phone. 

### What other libraries are similar to famo.us?

Framer.js by Koen Bok - http://framerjs.com/

Velocity.js by Julian Shapiro - http://julian.com/research/velocity/
