# Inbox

> Currently outdated (todo: update to LayoutBuilder) 

Inbox should show Messages that are intended for you.
What determines who can send you messages?
- have no limits on who can send messages, for now
- have an algorithm that limits sending?
- only actived when somebody legit sends you a message?
    - requires that you get "invited" manually by somebody?
    - (put tape over the person's mouth until they've been sent a message by somebody who we validated?)


target_user_id = my_user_id
