# Views

Every app is going to look different, but there are also common Views across many apps. Login pages, popovers/modals, welcome screens, and more are prevalent in most successful apps, so we'll provide sample pages for many of the most common. 

We'll also cover a number of common view pitfalls, such as handling the native keyboard nicely, or making sure your Content never overlaps your Header. While these are "minor" fixes, they become necessary to build an app that works akin to a native app for an end-user. 

The order of chapters is along the lines of what an end-user is going to see: Login/Signup, Welcome, Profile View, Inbox, etc.
