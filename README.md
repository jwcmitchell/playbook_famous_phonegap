My name is Nicholas Reed. I'm a web developer and this is the "Playbook" that I use while prototyping apps (Android, iOS and mobile web). 

The mobile apps are built primarily using Javascript, with a heavy emphasis on the use of the Famo.us framework for rendering views. Android and iOS apps are wrapped in Cordova/Phonegap so they have access to "native" functionality such as the Camera or Contacts. _Windows Phone is currently unsupported._

Through my experience building Cordova/PhoneGap apps, I've encountered many unknowns/bugs/features, and if you've tried building a PhoneGap app, you likely have as well. This guide is a series of patterns that can be used to augment existing knowledge, or can serve as a reference resource.

## "Waiting": a sample app 

Included, and referenced throughout, is a sample app called __Waiting__. Coupled with the included server (Chapter 10), it works as a complete showcase of many of the concepts referenced, and can easily serve as the foundation for your next project. 

__Waiting__ includes some useful features ande examples like:
- login and welcome pages
- friends and auto-connections 
- username searching
- dragging and momentum
- messaging
- Push Notifications for Android and iOS


Patterns and examples include:
- Comprehensive routing, including Back button
- Popovers/Modals
- Famo.us gotchas/clarifications
- Mouse/Finger movement and physics-based drag
- Welcome screens
- Wizards (step-by-step pages)
- Data fetching via models and collections
- Authentication
- Push Notifications
