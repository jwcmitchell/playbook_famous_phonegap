# Welcome!

My name is Nicholas Reed. I'm a web developer and this is the "Playbook" that I use while prototyping apps (for Android and iOS) and accompanying websites. 

Both the mobile apps and websites are built primarily using Javascript. The mobile apps are built using the Famo.us framework, and wrapped in Cordova/Phonegap. _Windows is currently unsupported._

Through my experience building Cordova/PhoneGap apps, I've encountered many unknowns/bugs/features, and if you've tried building a PhoneGap app, you likely have as well. This guide is a series of patterns that can be used to augment existing knowledge, or can serve as a reference resource.

## Sample App 

Included, and referenced throughout, is a sample app called __Waiting__. Coupled with a node.js server (soon to be released), it works as a complete showcase of many of the concepts referenced, and can be used as a jumping off point for many apps you'd like to build.

__Waiting__ includes some useful features like:
- login and welcome pages
- friends and invite-by-sms from local contacts
- username searching
- dragging and momentum
- messaging
- Push Notifications for Android and iOS


Patterns and examples include:
- Comprehensive routing, including Back button
- Popovers/Modals
- Famo.us gotchas/clarifications
- Mouse/Finger movement and physics-based drag
- Welcome screens
- Wizards (step-by-step pages)
- Data fetching via models and collections
- Authentication
- Push Notifications
