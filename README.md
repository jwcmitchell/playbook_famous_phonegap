This is a startup-in-a-box "playbook" that can be used to prototype apps (Android, iOS, and mobile web). 

The mobile apps are built primarily using Javascript, with a heavy emphasis on the use of the Famo.us framework for rendering views. Android and iOS apps are wrapped in Cordova/Phonegap so they have access to "native" functionality such as the Camera or Contacts. _Windows Phone is currently unsupported._ 

Through my experience building Cordova/PhoneGap apps, I've encountered many unknowns/bugs/features, and if you've tried building a PhoneGap app, you likely have as well. This guide has a number of patterns that can be used to augment existing knowledge, or can serve as a reference resource.

## Sample App and Server: "Waiting" 

> __ The app is being updated and will be in a state of heavy change until Jan 5, 2015! (Then an email will be sent to the mailing list)  __

Included in this playbook is a sample app named __Waiting__. Coupled with the included server (Chapter 10), it works as a complete showcase of many of the concepts referenced, and can easily serve as the foundation for your next project.
