#### Quick Overview: 

"PhoneGap" created by Nitobi in Vancouver, BC. 

Nitobi sold to Adobe, but wanted to keep all the "PhoneGap" code open-source. 

"Cordova" trademark created and donated to the Apache Foundation. 

"PhoneGap" trademark now owned by Adobe, and using the now open-source "Cordova" libraries. 

At this moment there are no competing services to "PhoneGap" so the two names may be used interchangebly in this book.
