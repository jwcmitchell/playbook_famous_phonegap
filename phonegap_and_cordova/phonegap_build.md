PhoneGap Build provides an easy way to compile your apps in the cloud and receive a downloadable APK (Android) or IPA (iOS).

### Build the Waiting/Internal App for Android

1. Sign up for a Free account on PhoneGap Build
2. Visit your Apps page (https://build.phonegap.com/apps)
5. Copy/Paste the GitHub repository: https://github.com/nicholasareed/internal_app.git (screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s11m679vkfbki7w/Screenshot%202014-08-16%2011.25.10.png)
6. Click `[Pull from .git repository]`
7. Click `[Build App]`
8. Wait until the page refreshes, and the "Download" button is available (1-5 minutes)
9. Success!

You should now have a working, unsigned .APK download available for Android.

#### iOS

iOS builds require a provisioning profile and certificate key (see Chapter 10: Production - iOS).
