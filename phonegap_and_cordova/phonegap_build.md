2. Visit your Apps page (https://build.phonegap.com/apps)
5. Copy/Paste the GitHub repository: https://github.com/nicholasareed/internal_app.git (screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s11m679vkfbki7w/Screenshot%202014-08-16%2011.25.10.png)
6. Click `[Pull from .git repository]`

Your app is building!


#### Android 

After the page refreshes and the "Download" button is available (1-5 minutes), you have a working, unsigned `waiting-debug.apk` download available for Android. 

#### iOS

iOS builds require a provisioning profile and certificate key (see Chapter 11.2: Production - iOS).
