# Display PageViews (router.js)

Our `router.js` is where you'll list all of the Pages your app will use, as well as the way those Pages will be loaded, and how to transition between them.

### history.js

First we load our `history.js` file.

        App.history = AppHistory(App);

> This is where you segue into reading about history.js!



### Routes, Views, and Stored Transitions

The subchapters in this section will expand on each of these topics.
